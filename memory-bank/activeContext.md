# Active Context: Prosim2GSX

## Current Focus
The current focus is on initializing the memory bank for the Prosim2GSX project. This involves creating the core documentation files to establish a baseline understanding of the project.

## Recent Changes
- Created memory bank structure with core documentation files
- Established project brief, product context, system patterns, and technical context

## Active Decisions
- Determining the appropriate level of detail for initial documentation
- Establishing a consistent documentation structure
- Identifying key components and relationships within the system

## Current Challenges
- Limited direct access to implementation details
- Need to infer system architecture from available information
- Balancing comprehensive documentation with practical utility

## Next Steps
1. Complete the initial memory bank setup
2. Review the codebase to validate architectural assumptions
3. Update documentation with more specific implementation details
4. Identify potential areas for improvement or enhancement
5. Establish development priorities based on user needs

## Open Questions
- What are the most common issues users encounter?
- Are there specific areas of the integration that need improvement?
- What are the current development priorities?
- Are there planned features not yet implemented?
- How well does the system handle edge cases and error conditions?

## Current State Assessment
The project appears to be a functional integration tool that successfully bridges Prosim A320 and GSX Pro. The architecture seems well-structured with clear separation of concerns and appropriate use of design patterns. The documentation provides a good overview of the system's purpose and functionality.

## Development Environment
The development environment is set up with the necessary tools and dependencies. The project structure follows standard .NET conventions with appropriate organization of components.

## User Feedback
No specific user feedback has been documented yet. This section will be updated as feedback is received and analyzed.

## Integration Status
The integration between Prosim A320 and GSX Pro appears to be working as described in the README. The system handles various ground service operations and synchronizes state between the two systems.

## Documentation Status
Initial documentation has been created in the memory bank. This will need to be refined and expanded as more information becomes available and as the project evolves.
