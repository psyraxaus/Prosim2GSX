# Active Context: Prosim2GSX

## Current Work Focus

The current focus for Prosim2GSX is implementing Phase 5 of the modularization strategy to refine the architecture and improve integration between all the modularized components. With Phases 1-4 largely complete (Phase 4.9 still pending), we're now focusing on optimizing service interactions, improving controller architecture, enhancing error handling, optimizing performance, implementing comprehensive testing, and completing documentation.

The .NET 8.0 migration has been completed successfully, and we're now working on leveraging .NET 8.0 features for performance improvements as part of Phase 5.4.

Additionally, a critical issue with the catering door opening prematurely has been identified and is being addressed. After a flight plan is loaded into the MCDU, the forward right passenger door is being opened immediately and going into a loop, when it should remain closed until the catering service specifically requests it to be opened. Phases 1 and 2 of the fix have been implemented, with Phase 3 still pending.

     - Ground equipment visualization
     - Enhanced progress visualization
   
   - Phase 4: Flight Phase Integration (2 weeks)
     - Flight phase detection enhancement
     - Contextual UI adaptation
     - Proactive notifications

   - Phase 5: Airline Theming System (3 weeks)
     - Theme configuration system
     - Visual theming components
     - Default airline themes
     - Theme editor (optional)
     - User documentation
   
   - Phase 6: Optimization and Polish (2 weeks)
     - Performance optimization
     - Usability enhancements
     - Accessibility improvements
     - Final polish

3. **Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Approach**
   - If time constraints are significant, a minimal viable product approach is defined
   - MVP Phase 1: Core Framework (2 weeks)
   - MVP Phase 2: Essential UI (3 weeks)
   - This approach would deliver a functional, if simplified, EFB-style interface in approximately 5 weeks

4. **Benefits of the EFB UI**
   - More realistic and intuitive experience resembling actual EFBs used by A320 pilots
   - Customization options for different airlines
   - Optimizations for secondary monitor use
   - Enhanced visualization of aircraft state and services
   - Contextual awareness and flight phase adaptation
   - Improved user feedback and interaction

## Active Decisions

### Decision Points
