# Active Context: Prosim2GSX

## Current Focus
The current focus is on upgrading the Prosim2GSX application from .NET 7 to .NET 8. This involves updating the target framework, dependencies, and ensuring compatibility with the new runtime.

## Recent Changes
- Migrated the application from .NET 7 to .NET 8
- Updated NuGet packages to their latest versions compatible with .NET 8
- Updated the application version from 0.3.0 to 0.4.0
- Updated the copyright year to 2025
- Updated memory bank documentation to reflect the .NET 8 migration

## Active Decisions
- Choosing to update to .NET 8 for improved performance and extended support
- Updating all NuGet packages to ensure compatibility with .NET 8
- Incrementing the version number to reflect the significant update

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring compatibility of all components with .NET 8
- Verifying that updated NuGet packages work correctly with the application
- Testing the application thoroughly after the migration

## Next Steps
1. Perform thorough testing of all application features
2. Verify integration with Prosim A320 and GSX Pro
3. Test service synchronization and audio control features
4. Create release notes documenting the migration to .NET 8
5. Consider further improvements leveraging new .NET 8 features

## Open Questions
- What are the most common issues users encounter?
- Are there specific areas of the integration that need improvement?
- What are the current development priorities?
- Are there planned features not yet implemented?
- How well does the system handle edge cases and error conditions?

## Current State Assessment
The project appears to be a functional integration tool that successfully bridges Prosim A320 and GSX Pro. The architecture seems well-structured with clear separation of concerns and appropriate use of design patterns. The documentation provides a good overview of the system's purpose and functionality.

## Development Environment
The development environment now requires .NET 8 SDK for building the application. The project structure follows standard .NET conventions with appropriate organization of components.

## User Feedback
No specific user feedback has been documented yet. This section will be updated as feedback is received and analyzed.

## Integration Status
The integration between Prosim A320 and GSX Pro appears to be working as described in the README. The system handles various ground service operations and synchronizes state between the two systems.

## Documentation Status
Initial documentation has been created in the memory bank. This will need to be refined and expanded as more information becomes available and as the project evolves.
