# Active Context: Prosim2GSX

## Current Focus
The current focus is on improving the LVAR subscription system and door operation handling in the Prosim2GSX application. This involves implementing a callback-based approach for LVAR changes and enhancing the synchronization between GSX services and Prosim door operations.

## Recent Changes
- Implemented a callback-based system for LVAR value changes in MobiSimConnect.cs
- Added a dictionary-based approach to map service toggle LVAR names to door operations
- Enhanced cargo loading integration with automatic door operation
- Improved catering state management with dedicated callbacks
- Added better error handling for LVAR callbacks
- Previously: Migrated the application from .NET 7 to .NET 8
- Previously: Updated NuGet packages to their latest versions compatible with .NET 8
- Previously: Updated the application version from 0.3.0 to 0.4.0

## Active Decisions
- Implementing a callback pattern for LVAR changes to improve responsiveness
- Using a dictionary-based approach for service toggle handling to improve code organization
- Enhancing door operation logic based on service states
- Previously: Choosing to update to .NET 8 for improved performance and extended support

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring the callback system handles all edge cases properly
- Managing the lifecycle of callbacks to prevent memory leaks
- Coordinating the timing of door operations with GSX service states
- Testing the new LVAR subscription system thoroughly

## Next Steps
1. Perform thorough testing of the new LVAR subscription system
2. Verify door operation synchronization with GSX services
3. Consider extending the callback pattern to other parts of the application
4. Optimize performance of the callback system
5. Document the new callback pattern for future development

## Open Questions
- What are the most common issues users encounter?
- Are there specific areas of the integration that need improvement?
- What are the current development priorities?
- Are there planned features not yet implemented?
- How well does the system handle edge cases and error conditions?

## Current State Assessment
The project appears to be a functional integration tool that successfully bridges Prosim A320 and GSX Pro. The architecture seems well-structured with clear separation of concerns and appropriate use of design patterns. The documentation provides a good overview of the system's purpose and functionality.

## Development Environment
The development environment now requires .NET 8 SDK for building the application. The project structure follows standard .NET conventions with appropriate organization of components.

## User Feedback
No specific user feedback has been documented yet. This section will be updated as feedback is received and analyzed.

## Integration Status
The integration between Prosim A320 and GSX Pro appears to be working as described in the README. The system handles various ground service operations and synchronizes state between the two systems.

## Documentation Status
Initial documentation has been created in the memory bank. This will need to be refined and expanded as more information becomes available and as the project evolves.
