# Active Context: Prosim2GSX

## Current Work Focus

The current focus for Prosim2GSX is implementing the EFB UI while continuing to refine the architecture and improve integration between all the modularized components. With Phase 4 of the EFB UI implementation now complete, we're focusing on preparing for Phase 5 (Airline Theming System) while also continuing work on Phase 5 of the modularization strategy.

The .NET 8.0 migration has been completed successfully, and we've successfully implemented .NET 8.0 features for performance improvements as part of Phase 5.4.

Additionally, a critical issue with the catering door opening prematurely has been identified and has been addressed. After a flight plan is loaded into the MCDU, the forward right passenger door was being opened immediately and going into a loop, when it should remain closed until the catering service specifically requests it to be opened. All three phases of the fix have been successfully implemented, resolving the issue completely.
