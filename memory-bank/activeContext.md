   - Dependency injection enables better mocking for tests
   - Reduced coupling makes unit testing more effective

3. **Better Extensibility**
   - New features can be added with minimal changes to existing code
   - Services can be enhanced independently
   - New integrations can be implemented without affecting core functionality

4. **Reduced Complexity**
   - Each service has a single responsibility
   - Dependencies are explicit and manageable
   - State management is more predictable
