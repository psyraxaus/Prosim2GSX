# Active Context: Prosim2GSX

## Current Work Focus

The current focus for Prosim2GSX is implementing Phase 5 of the modularization strategy to refine the architecture and improve integration between all the modularized components. With Phases 1-4 largely complete (Phase 4.9 still pending), we're now focusing on optimizing service interactions, improving controller architecture, enhancing error handling, optimizing performance, implementing comprehensive testing, and completing documentation.

The .NET 8.0 migration has been completed successfully, and we've successfully implemented .NET 8.0 features for performance improvements as part of Phase 5.4.

Additionally, a critical issue with the catering door opening prematurely has been identified and is being addressed. After a flight plan is loaded into the MCDU, the forward right passenger door is being opened immediately and going into a loop, when it should remain closed until the catering service specifically requests it to be opened. Phases 1 and 2 of the fix have been implemented, with Phase 3 still pending.

Based on the modularization progress and code review, Prosim2GSX is in a transitional state with the following characteristics:

1. **Architecture Transition**
   - Moving from a monolithic design to a modular service-oriented architecture
   - Core services have been extracted and are functioning well
   - GSX services extraction is complete
   - Further GSX Controller modularization is in progress (Phase 4.8 completed)
   - Improved separation of concerns and testability

2. **Functional Status**
   - Core functionality remains intact during the modularization
   - Service automation is working with the new architecture
   - Audio control has been improved with the new GSXAudioService
   - State management has been enhanced with the improved GSXStateManager
   - Fuel management has been improved with the new GSXFuelCoordinator
   - User interface remains unchanged during the architectural improvements

3. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Enhanced error handling and logging
   - Better thread safety in critical services
   - Improved event-based communication
   - More consistent patterns and practices
   - State machine enhancements for better predictability and control
   - Performance optimizations with .NET 8.0 features

4. **Testing Status**
   - Manual testing confirms functionality is maintained
   - Unit testing strategy has been defined
   - Some unit tests have been implemented for new services
   - Comprehensive testing plan is in place for future phases

## Next Steps

The following steps are recommended for continued development and improvement of Prosim2GSX:

### Short-term Tasks

1. **Complete Phase 4.9: Comprehensive Testing**
   - Create unit tests for all new coordinators
   - Implement integration tests for coordinator interactions
   - Verify all major workflows
   - Test edge cases and error handling

2. **Implement Phase 5.5: Comprehensive Testing**
   - Implement unit tests for all services
   - Create integration tests for service interactions
   - Add performance tests for critical paths
   - Document testing approach and patterns
   - Create test fixtures and helpers

### Medium-term Tasks

1. **Implement Phase 3 of Catering Door Fix**
   - Enhance logging for door operations
   - Implement explicit door state initialization
   - Verify fix with different airline configurations

3. **Evaluate Phase 2 .NET 8.0 Performance Improvements**
   - Assess potential benefits of System.Threading.Channels
   - Evaluate object pooling for frequently created objects
   - Consider IMemoryCache for caching expensive operations
   - Measure performance impact and adjust implementation as needed

### Long-term Goals

1. **Complete Modularization**
   - Finish all phases of the modularization strategy
   - Refine architecture and improve integration
   - Implement comprehensive testing

2. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Develop EFB-style UI as outlined in efb-ui-implementation-strategy.md
   - Implement the phased approach for EFB UI development
   - Enhance status feedback and visualization
   - Improve configuration options with airline-specific theming
   - Optimize for secondary monitor use

3. **Extens
