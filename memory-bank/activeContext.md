# Active Context: Prosim2GSX

## Current Work Focus

The current focus for Prosim2GSX is establishing the initial memory bank to document the project comprehensively. This includes understanding the existing codebase, architecture, and functionality to create a solid foundation for future development and maintenance.

### Primary Objectives

1. **Documentation Establishment**
   - Create comprehensive memory bank files
   - Document system architecture and patterns
   - Capture technical context and dependencies

2. **Codebase Familiarization**
   - Understand the existing code structure
   - Identify key components and their relationships
   - Map the flow of data through the system

3. **Feature Assessment**
   - Identify implemented features
   - Evaluate feature completeness
   - Document known issues or limitations

## Recent Changes

As this is the initial memory bank creation, there are no recent changes to document. Future updates to this section will track significant code changes, feature additions, bug fixes, and other relevant modifications to the codebase.

## Current State Assessment

Based on the initial code review, Prosim2GSX appears to be a functional application with the following key components implemented:

1. **Core Integration**
   - Connection to ProsimA320 via ProSim SDK
   - Connection to MSFS2020 via SimConnect
   - Basic flight state management

2. **Service Automation**
   - Boarding and deboarding synchronization
   - Refueling synchronization
   - Catering service calls
   - Ground equipment management

3. **User Interface**
   - System tray application
   - Configuration UI with settings
   - Status indicators for connections

4. **Additional Features**
   - Audio control for GSX and other applications
   - ACARS integration for loadsheets
   - Flight plan synchronization

## Next Steps

The following steps are recommended for continued development and improvement of Prosim2GSX:

### Short-term Tasks

   - Visual feedback for service operations
   - Improved configuration UI

3. **Robustness Enhancements**
   - Better handling of connection failures
   - Automatic recovery from errors
   - Comprehensive logging and diagnostics

## Active Decisions

### Decision Points

1. **Architecture Approach**
   - Continue with the current modular architecture
   - Maintain clear separation of concerns
   - Preserve the state machine pattern for flight phases

2. **Integration Strategy**
   - Focus on stability of existing integrations
   - Ensure reliable operation with current versions
   - Maintain compatibility with future updates

3. **Feature Prioritization**
   - Prioritize stability and reliability over new features
   - Focus on improving existing functionality
   - Address user-reported issues first

### Open Questions

1. **Version Compatibility**
   - How will the application handle different versions of ProsimA320?
   - What is the compatibility strategy for MSFS2020 updates?
   - How to manage GSX Pro version changes?

2. **Error Handling**
   - What is the strategy for handling connection failures?
   - How should the application recover from unexpected states?
   - What level of logging is appropriate for troubleshooting?

3. **User Experience**
   - Is the current UI sufficient for user needs?
   - Are there additional configuration options needed?
   - How can the application provide better feedback during operations?

## Current Challenges

1. **Integration Stability**
   - Maintaining reliable connections to external systems
   - Handling unexpected behavior from ProsimA320 or GSX
   - Managing state synchronization across systems

2. **Configuration Complexity**
   - Balancing flexibility with usability
   - Providing appropriate defaults
   - Explaining complex options to users

3. **Testing Limitations**
   - Difficulty in automated testing due to external dependencies
   - Need for manual testing with actual flight simulator
   - Variability in user environments and configurations
