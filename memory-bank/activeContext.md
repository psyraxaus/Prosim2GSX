# Active Context: Prosim2GSX

## Current Focus
The current focus has been on enhancing the cargo door logic and catering service door operation in the Prosim2GSX application. This involved implementing a dictionary-based approach for service toggle handling, improving door operations based on service states, and enhancing the synchronization between GSX services and Prosim. The implementation of automatic cargo door management based on loading status and catering state has been completed and thoroughly tested. Additionally, the refueling process has been enhanced with fuel hose state management via callbacks.

## Recent Changes
- Completed thorough testing of the enhanced refueling process, confirming proper functionality
- Completed verification of fuel synchronization between GSX and Prosim
- Completed testing of the new LVAR subscription system, confirming proper functionality
- Enhanced the cargo door logic with automatic operation based on loading status and catering state
- Completed thorough testing of cargo door integration with GSX, confirming proper opening and closing behavior
- Completed thorough testing of catering service door operation, verifying correct functionality
- Implemented dedicated door operation methods in GSXController (OperateFrontDoor, OperateAftDoor, OperateFrontCargoDoor, OperateAftCargoDoor)
- Added constants for different service states (GSX_WAITING_STATE, GSX_FINISHED_STATE, GSX_COMPLETED_STATE)
- Enhanced the refueling process with fuel hose state management via callbacks
- Implemented pause/resume functionality for refueling based on fuel hose connection state
- Improved center of gravity calculations for more accurate MACZFW and MACTOW values
- Added better fuel target calculation with rounding to nearest 100
- Implemented a callback-based system for LVAR value changes in MobiSimConnect.cs
- Added a dictionary-based approach to map service toggle LVAR names to door operations
- Enhanced cargo loading integration with automatic door operation
- Improved catering state management with dedicated callbacks
- Added better error handling for LVAR callbacks
- Added automatic cargo door closing when cargo loading reaches 100%
- Previously: Migrated the application from .NET 7 to .NET 8
- Previously: Updated NuGet packages to their latest versions compatible with .NET 8
- Previously: Updated the application version from 0.3.0 to 0.4.0

## Active Decisions
- Implementing a callback pattern for LVAR changes to improve responsiveness
- Using a dictionary-based approach for service toggle handling to improve code organization
- Enhancing door operation logic based on service states (waiting, finished, completed)
- Implementing automatic door operations for catering and cargo services
- Implementing fuel hose state management to improve refueling realism
- Enhancing center of gravity calculations for more accurate loadsheet data
- Using constants for service states to improve code readability and maintainability
- Previously: Choosing to update to .NET 8 for improved performance and extended support

## Current Challenges
- Ensuring the callback system handles all edge cases properly
- Managing the lifecycle of callbacks to prevent memory leaks
- Coordinating the timing of door operations with GSX service states
- Testing the new LVAR subscription system thoroughly
- Ensuring accurate fuel synchronization between GSX and Prosim
- Handling edge cases in the refueling process (disconnection, reconnection)
- Ensuring proper door operation timing based on catering and cargo loading states
- Testing the automatic door operations with various service scenarios

## Next Steps
1. Complete thorough testing of center of gravity calculations with various aircraft loading scenarios
2. Consider extending the callback pattern to other parts of the application
3. Optimize performance of the callback system
4. Document the new callback pattern, door operation logic, and refueling enhancements for future development
5. Explore potential improvements to error handling for edge cases
6. Consider adding more configuration options for door operation behavior
7. Evaluate performance impact of the callback system under heavy load

## Open Questions
- What are the most common issues users encounter?
- Are there specific areas of the integration that need improvement?
- What are the current development priorities?
- Are there planned features not yet implemented?
- How well does the system handle edge cases and error conditions?

## Current State Assessment
The project appears to be a functional integration tool that successfully bridges Prosim A320 and GSX Pro. The architecture seems well-structured with clear separation of concerns and appropriate use of design patterns. The documentation provides a good overview of the system's purpose and functionality.

## Development Environment
The development environment now requires .NET 8 SDK for building the application. The project structure follows standard .NET conventions with appropriate organization of components.

## User Feedback
No specific user feedback has been documented yet. This section will be updated as feedback is received and analyzed.

## Integration Status
The integration between Prosim A320 and GSX Pro appears to be working as described in the README. The system handles various ground service operations and synchronizes state between the two systems.

## Documentation Status
Initial documentation has been created in the memory bank. This will need to be refined and expanded as more information becomes available and as the project evolves.
