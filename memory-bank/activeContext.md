# Active Context: Prosim2GSX

## Current Focus
The current focus has been on updating the user interface to a new Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) look, providing a more modern and intuitive interface for users. This UI redesign improves the visual appearance and usability of the application while maintaining all the existing functionality. The new EFB-style interface follows design patterns common in modern aviation applications, making the tool more familiar to pilots who use similar interfaces in their flight operations.

Prior to this UI update, the focus was on implementing an event aggregator system to improve the UI responsiveness and decouple components in the application. This implementation follows the publisher-subscriber pattern, allowing different parts of the application to communicate without direct dependencies. The event aggregator system enables real-time updates to the UI when monitored items change, such as service statuses, connection states, and flight phases.

Additionally, previous work focused on enhancing the center of gravity (CG) calculations for more accurate loadsheet data, implementing a new Prosim dataref subscription system, and enhancing the cockpit door integration between Prosim and GSX. The CG calculation improvements involve sophisticated methods to accurately determine the Zero Fuel Weight Center of Gravity (MACZFW) and Take Off Weight Center of Gravity (MACTOW) by temporarily manipulating fuel states and reading values directly from Prosim. The dataref subscription system involved creating a callback-based monitoring system for Prosim datarefs and implementing synchronization between the cockpit door state in Prosim and the corresponding LVAR in GSX. The implementation allows the cockpit door to muffle cabin sounds when closed, enhancing the realism of the simulation. Additionally, the previous work on cargo door logic, catering service door operation, and refueling process enhancements has been thoroughly tested and verified.
