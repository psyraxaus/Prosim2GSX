# Theme System Type Conversion Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the fixes implemented to address type conversion issues in the theme system, particularly focusing on the FontWeight conversion error that was causing runtime exceptions when navigating to the Settings page.

## Problem Description

The application was encountering a `System.InvalidCastException` with the message:

```
Unable to cast object of type 'System.String' to type 'System.Windows.FontWeight'.
```

This error occurred during text rendering when trying to get a typeface for a TextBlock element. The root cause was that string values were being directly assigned to FontWeight properties without proper conversion.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Enhanced ResourceConverter

The `ResourceConverter` class has been enhanced to ensure proper type conversions:

- Added more robust FontWeight conversion with multiple fallback mechanisms
- Added detailed logging for conversion operations
- Improved error handling with appropriate fallbacks
- Added type checking to handle cases where the input might already be of the correct type

Key improvements in `ConvertToFontWeight` method:
```csharp
// Check if input is already a FontWeight
if (fontWeightString is FontWeight fontWeight)
{
    return fontWeight;
}

// Multiple parsing strategies with proper error handling
try
{
    var converter = System.ComponentModel.TypeDescriptor.GetConverter(typeof(FontWeight));
    if (converter != null && converter.CanConvertFrom(typeof(string)))
    {
        return (FontWeight)converter.ConvertFromString(null, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, fontWeightString);
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Logger.Log(LogLevel.Warning, "ResourceConverter:ConvertToFontWeight", 
        $"TypeConverter failed for font weight '{fontWeightString}': {ex.Message}");
}

// Additional fallback for numeric values
try
{
    if (double.TryParse(fontWeightString, out double doubleWeight))
    {
        return new FontWeight(doubleWeight);
    }
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Logger.Log(LogLevel.Warning, "ResourceConverter:ConvertToFontWeight", 
        $"Direct FontWeight construction failed for '{fontWeightString}': {ex.Message}");
}
```

### 2. Improved EFBThemeManager

The `EFBThemeManager` class has been updated to ensure proper type conversions when applying themes:

- Enhanced `ConvertJsonToThemeDefinition` method to use appropriate converters for different resource types
- Updated `ApplyTheme` method to perform explicit type conversions for all resource types
- Improved `ConvertResourceValue` method to handle different value types appropriately
- Added detailed logging for resource application

Key improvements in `ApplyTheme` method:
```csharp
// Ensure proper type conversion for specific resource types
if (resource.Key.EndsWith("FontWeight", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) && 
    resource.Value is string fontWeightString)
{
    // Convert string to FontWeight
    Application.Current.Resources[resource.Key] = ResourceConverter.ConvertToFontWeight(fontWeightString);
}
else if (resource.Key.EndsWith("FontFamily", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase) && 
         resource.Value is string fontFamilyString)
{
    // Convert string to FontFamily
    Application.Current.Resources[resource.Key] = FontUtilities.ConvertToFontFamily(fontFamilyString);
}
// Similar handling for other resource types...
```

## Additional Safeguards

1. **Type Checking**: Added type checking before resource usage to prevent type mismatch errors
2. **Fallback Mechanisms**: Implemented fallback mechanisms for invalid resource types
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Added more detailed logging for resource conversion failures
4. **Defensive Coding**: Added defensive coding to handle edge cases and unexpected inputs

## Testing

The fixes have been tested by:

1. Navigating to the Settings page to verify the FontWeight conversion error is resolved
2. Testing other UI elements that use theme resources to ensure they display correctly
3. Verifying that theme changes work properly with the new conversion logic

## Future Improvements

1. **Unit Tests**: Add unit tests for resource conversion methods to ensure they handle all edge cases
2. **Resource Validation**: Add validation for theme resources at load time to catch issues early
3. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize resource conversion for frequently used resources
4. **Documentation**: Update developer documentation with guidelines for working with theme resources

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes address the immediate FontWeight conversion issue and provide a more robust framework for handling type conversions in the theme system. The changes maintain backward compatibility while improving error handling and providing better diagnostics through enhanced logging.
