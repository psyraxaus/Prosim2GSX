# Prosim2GSX Project Rules and Patterns

## Project Conventions

### Naming Conventions
- Use PascalCase for class names, public methods, and properties
- Use camelCase for local variables and private fields
- Prefix private fields with underscore (_)
- Use descriptive names that clearly indicate purpose

### Code Organization
- Group related functionality into separate controllers
- Use interfaces for dependency injection
- Keep UI logic separate from business logic
- Follow MVVM pattern for UI components
- Use callback pattern for LVAR value changes
- Implement dictionary-based action mapping for service toggles
- Use dataref subscription pattern for Prosim state monitoring
- Implement partial classes for organizing related functionality (e.g., ProsimController.DataRefMonitor.cs)

### Documentation
- Document public APIs with limited comments that are concise and to the point
- Include parameter descriptions and return values
- Document complex logic with inline comments
- Keep README updated with configuration requirements
- Document callback parameters and expected behavior
- Document dataref subscription handlers with clear purpose and behavior

## Development Workflow

### Environment Setup
- Ensure .NET 8 Runtime is installed
- MobiFlight WASM Module must be in MSFS Community folder
- Test with both Prosim and GSX Pro running
- Start application before MSFS or when MSFS is in the main menu

### Testing Process
- Test each service flow individually
- Verify synchronization between systems
- Check edge cases (e.g., service interruptions)
- Test with various configuration settings
- Verify callback execution with different LVAR change scenarios
- Test door operations with different service states
- Test dataref subscription with various change frequencies
- Verify thread safety of dataref monitoring system

### Debugging Tips
- Check logs for error messages
- Verify connections to all systems
- Monitor state changes during service calls
- Test with minimal configuration first

## User Preferences

### Configuration
- Most users prefer automatic service calls
- Audio control is a highly valued feature
- Configuration UI should be simple and intuitive
- Tooltips should explain each option clearly

### Service Flow
- Pre-flight preparation should be automatic
- Departure sequence should be predictable
- Arrival services should initialize automatically
- Turnaround should work without manual intervention

## Common Pitfalls

### Integration Issues
- GSX Pro settings can affect integration
- Prosim Auto-Door and Auto-Jetway must be disabled
- FS2Crew compatibility issues
- Audio control limitations between sessions

### Error Handling
- Gracefully handle connection failures
- Provide clear error messages
- Recover from service interruptions
- Maintain state consistency
- Implement try-catch blocks in callbacks to prevent cascading failures
- Validate value changes before triggering callbacks
- Handle exceptions in dataref handlers to prevent monitoring system failures
- Log detailed information for debugging dataref subscription issues

## Project-Specific Knowledge

### Critical Paths
- Service flow orchestration is central to functionality
- Event handling between systems must be reliable
- Configuration persistence is essential
- State synchronization must be accurate

### System Interactions
- Prosim events trigger service calls
- GSX Pro services affect Prosim state
- MSFS provides the environment context
- MobiFlight extends variable access
- LVAR changes trigger registered callbacks
- Service toggle changes trigger door operations
- Prosim dataref changes trigger registered handlers
- Cockpit door state changes update GSX sound muffling

### Performance Considerations
- Minimize CPU usage during flight
- Avoid blocking UI thread
- Handle events efficiently
- Limit unnecessary service calls
- Only trigger callbacks when values actually change
- Use efficient dictionary lookups for action mapping
- Balance dataref monitoring frequency with performance impact
- Use appropriate monitoring intervals for different types of datarefs
- Consider thread synchronization overhead in multi-threaded monitoring

## Future Development

### Potential Enhancements
- Expanded automation capabilities
- Improved error recovery
- Enhanced configuration options
- Better compatibility with other add-ons

### Technical Improvements
- Refactor for better testability
- Enhance logging for troubleshooting
- Optimize performance for resource usage
- Improve error handling and recovery
- Extend callback pattern to other parts of the application
- Optimize callback performance
- Identify additional datarefs that could benefit from subscription
- Implement priority levels for different dataref monitors
- Optimize monitoring intervals based on dataref change frequency
