# Progress Tracking: Prosim2GSX

## Project Status
The Prosim2GSX project is in a functional state with the core integration between Prosim A320 and GSX Pro working as expected. Recent implementation of sophisticated center of gravity (CG) calculation methods has significantly improved the accuracy of loadsheet data, providing realistic MACZFW and MACTOW values through temporary fuel state manipulation. The comprehensive Prosim dataref subscription system and cockpit door integration have further enhanced the application's capabilities and realism. The dataref subscription system provides a robust foundation for monitoring Prosim state changes, while the cockpit door integration allows for realistic sound muffling when the cockpit door is closed. Previous enhancements to the refueling process and improvements to the LVAR subscription system have also significantly improved the realism and reliability of the application. The application has been successfully migrated from .NET 7 to .NET 8, with all dependencies updated to their latest compatible versions.

- üìã Optimizing the monitoring interval for different types of datarefs
- üìã Implementing priority levels for different dataref monitors
- üìã Extending the callback pattern to other parts of the application

## Known Issues
Based on the README, there are some known considerations:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential issues when used with FS2Crew (specifically "FS2Crew: Prosim A320 Edition")
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GSX audio may stay muted when switching to another plane if it was muted during the session
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Extreme passenger density setting in GSX breaks boarding functionality

## Configuration Requirements
The following configuration requirements are noted:

### Prosim Configuration
- Disable Auto-Door and Auto-Jetway Simulation in the EFB

### GSX Pro Configuration
- No customized Aircraft Config should be used
- "Assistance services Auto Mode" should be disabled
- "Always refuel progressively" and "Detect custom aircraft system refueling" may need to be disabled if refueling issues occur
- Passenger Density setting should not be set to "Extreme"

## Testing Status
Initial build testing of the .NET 8 migration has been completed successfully. Comprehensive functional testing is still needed to ensure all features work correctly with the new framework.

## Documentation Status
- ‚úÖ README with installation and usage instructions
- ‚úÖ Configuration requirements documented
- ‚úÖ Service flow documented
- ‚úÖ Memory bank initialized and updated for .NET 8 migration
- ‚úÖ Technical documentation updated to reflect .NET 8 requirements

## Next Development Priorities
Current development priorities include:

1. Identifying additional Prosim datarefs that could benefit from the subscription system
2. Optimizing the monitoring interval for different types of datarefs
3. Thorough testing of the .NET 8 migration
4. Creating release notes for the recent updates
5. Addressing known issues with FS2Crew compatibility
6. Improving audio control persistence between sessions
7. Adding support for the "Extreme" passenger density setting
8. Expanding automation capabilities to include Push-Back, De-Ice, and Gate-Selection
9. Enhancing error handling and recovery mechanisms
10. Adding more configuration options for advanced users
11. Exploring new features available in .NET 8

## Deployment Status
The project is in a deployable state following the .NET 8 migration. The README will need to be updated to reflect the new .NET 8 runtime requirement before the next release.

## User Adoption
No specific information on user adoption is available at this time.

## Performance Metrics
No performance metrics are documented. Future updates could include:

- Service call response times
- Synchronization accuracy
