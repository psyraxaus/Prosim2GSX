# Progress Tracking: Prosim2GSX

## Project Status
The Prosim2GSX project is in a functional state with the core integration between Prosim A320 and GSX Pro working as expected. Recent enhancements to the refueling process and improvements to the LVAR subscription system have significantly improved the realism and reliability of the application. The refueling process now properly handles fuel hose connection states and provides more accurate center of gravity calculations. The application has been successfully migrated from .NET 7 to .NET 8, with all dependencies updated to their latest compatible versions.

## Implemented Features

### Framework and Infrastructure

- ‚úÖ Version updated to 0.4.0

### Core Integration
- ‚úÖ Basic connectivity between Prosim A320 and GSX Pro
- ‚úÖ Event monitoring and synchronization with callback support
- ‚úÖ Configuration persistence
- ‚úÖ Improved door operation based on service states

### Service Synchronization

- ‚úÖ Implemented pause/resume functionality for refueling based on fuel hose connection
- ‚úÖ Improved center of gravity calculations for accurate MACZFW and MACTOW values
- ‚úÖ Added better fuel target calculation with rounding to nearest 100
- ‚úÖ Passenger and cargo boarding/deboarding synchronization
- ‚úÖ Ground equipment automation (GPU, Chocks, PCA)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced cargo door operation based on loading percentage
- ‚úÖ Improved catering state management with dedicated callbacks
- ‚úÖ Implemented automatic door operations based on catering service states
- ‚úÖ Added constants for different service states (waiting, finished, completed)
- ‚úÖ Implemented automatic cargo door closing when cargo loading reaches 100%
- ‚úÖ Completed testing of enhanced catering service door logic
- ‚úÖ Completed verification of door operation synchronization with GSX catering and cargo services
- ‚úÖ Completed testing of automatic cargo door closing when cargo loading reaches 100%
- ‚úÖ Completed testing of the enhanced refueling process
- ‚úÖ Completed verification of fuel synchronization between GSX and Prosim
- ‚úÖ Completed testing of the new LVAR subscription system

### Automation
- ‚úÖ Automatic service calls (except Push-Back, De-Ice, Gate-Selection)
- ‚úÖ Automatic jetway/stair operation
- ‚úÖ Automatic ground equipment placement/removal

### Audio Control
- ‚úÖ GSX audio control via INT-Knob
- ‚úÖ ATC volume control via VHF1-Knob

### User Interface
- ‚úÖ System tray icon for configuration access
- ‚úÖ Configuration UI with tooltips
- ‚úÖ Persistent settings

## In Progress Features
- üîÑ Testing of center of gravity calculations with various aircraft loading scenarios
- üîÑ Testing of the .NET 8 migration to ensure all functionality works as expected

## Planned Features
- üìã Extending the callback pattern to other parts of the application
- üìã Optimizing performance of the callback system
- üìã Further improvements to service state synchronization

## Known Issues
Based on the README, there are some known considerations:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential issues when used with FS2Crew (specifically "FS2Crew: Prosim A320 Edition")
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GSX audio may stay muted when switching to another plane if it was muted during the session
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Extreme passenger density setting in GSX breaks boarding functionality

## Configuration Requirements
The following configuration requirements are noted:

### Prosim Configuration
- Disable Auto-Door and Auto-Jetway Simulation in the EFB

### GSX Pro Configuration
- No customized Aircraft Config should be used
- "Assistance services Auto Mode" should be disabled
- "Always refuel progressively" and "Detect custom aircraft system refueling" may need to be disabled if refueling issues occur
- Passenger Density setting should not be set to "Extreme"

## Testing Status
Initial build testing of the .NET 8 migration has been completed successfully. Comprehensive functional testing is still needed to ensure all features work correctly with the new framework.

## Documentation Status
- ‚úÖ README with installation and usage instructions
- ‚úÖ Configuration requirements documented
- ‚úÖ Service flow documented
- ‚úÖ Memory bank initialized and updated for .NET 8 migration
- ‚úÖ Technical documentation updated to reflect .NET 8 requirements

## Next Development Priorities
Current development priorities include:

1. Thorough testing of center of gravity calculations with various aircraft loading scenarios
2. Thorough testing of the .NET 8 migration
3. Creating release notes for the recent updates
4. Addressing known issues with FS2Crew compatibility
5. Improving audio control persistence between sessions
6. Adding support for the "Extreme" passenger density setting
7. Expanding automation capabilities to include Push-Back, De-Ice, and Gate-Selection
8. Enhancing error handling and recovery mechanisms
9. Adding more configuration options for advanced users
10. Exploring new features available in .NET 8

## Deployment Status
The project is in a deployable state following the .NET 8 migration. The README will need to be updated to reflect the new .NET 8 runtime requirement before the next release.

## User Adoption
No specific information on user adoption is available at this time.

## Performance Metrics
No performance metrics are documented. Future updates could include:

- Service call response times
- Synchronization accuracy
- Resource usage statistics
- Error rates during operation
