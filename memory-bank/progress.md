# Progress Tracking: Prosim2GSX

## Project Status
The Prosim2GSX project is in a functional state with the core integration between Prosim A320 and GSX Pro working as expected. Recent simplifications to the loadsheet generation process have improved the reliability and maintainability of the application. By removing redundant custom weight and balance calculations and fully relying on Prosim's native loadsheet functionality, we've reduced complexity and potential points of failure in the code. The redundant variables and methods related to custom weight and balance calculations have been removed from GsxController.cs and ProsimController.cs, while keeping the enhanced error handling, server status checking, and retry logic in ProsimLoadsheetService.cs.

Prior to these simplifications, improvements to error handling for loadsheet generation and fixes for deboarding state handling have enhanced the reliability and robustness of the application. The implementation of server status checking, detailed HTTP status code interpretation, and better retry logic has significantly improved the diagnostics and recovery capabilities for loadsheet generation. The fixes to deboarding state handling have resolved an issue where deboarding was being called prematurely during departure.

The user interface has been updated to a new Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) look, providing a more modern and intuitive interface for users. This UI redesign improves the visual appearance and usability of the application while maintaining all the existing functionality. The new EFB-style interface follows design patterns common in modern aviation applications, making the tool more familiar to pilots who use similar interfaces in their flight operations.

Prior to this UI update, the implementation of an event aggregator system has significantly improved the UI responsiveness and decoupled components in the application. This implementation follows the publisher-subscriber pattern, allowing different parts of the application to communicate without direct dependencies. The event aggregator system enables real-time updates to the UI when monitored items change, such as service statuses, connection states, and flight phases.

The comprehensive Prosim dataref subscription system and cockpit door integration have further enhanced the application's capabilities and realism. The dataref subscription system provides a robust foundation for monitoring Prosim state changes, while the cockpit door integration allows for realistic sound muffling when the cockpit door is closed. Previous enhancements to the refueling process and improvements to the LVAR subscription system have also significantly improved the realism and reliability of the application. The application has been successfully migrated from .NET 7 to .NET 8, with all dependencies updated to their latest compatible versions.

- ⚠️ GSX audio may stay muted when switching to another plane if it was muted during the session
- ⚠️ Extreme passenger density setting in GSX breaks boarding functionality

## Recently Fixed Issues
- ✅ Simplified loadsheet generation by removing redundant custom weight and balance calculations
  - Root cause: Unnecessary complexity and potential points of failure in the code
  - Solution: Removed redundant variables and methods related to custom weight and balance calculations, fully relying on Prosim's native loadsheet functionality
- ✅ Fixed issues with loadsheet generation error handling
  - Root cause: Insufficient error handling and diagnostics for loadsheet generation failures
  - Solution: Implemented server status checking, detailed HTTP status code interpretation, better retry logic, and enhanced logging
- ✅ Fixed issue with deboarding being called prematurely during departure
  - Root cause: Deboarding state variable was being updated regardless of the current flight phase
  - Solution: Modified the OnDeboardingStateChanged handler to only update the currentDeboardState variable when in the appropriate flight state (ARRIVAL or TAXIIN)
- ✅ Fixed application crash when default SimBrief ID is 0
  - Root cause: The SimbriefIdRequiredEvent handler was causing a crash in KernelBase.dll after displaying a message box and switching to the Settings tab
  - Solution: Removed the redundant SimbriefIdRequiredEvent system and implemented a more robust first-time setup dialog that validates the SimBrief ID at application startup
- ✅ Fixed issues with VHF2, VHF3, CAB, and PA channels not controlling VoiceMeeter
  - Root cause: IsXControllable() methods required process names even when using VoiceMeeter
  - Solution: Modified these methods to work with VoiceMeeter even with empty process names
- ✅ Fixed an issue where the code was trying to set read-only _REC datarefs
  - Root cause: UpdateVoiceMeeterParameters method was trying to set read-only datarefs
  - Solution: Removed the code that was trying to set these datarefs, only reading them instead
- ✅ Fixed an issue with MSFS connection status not showing correctly in the UI despite simRunning being true
  - Root cause: Connection status events were published before the UI had subscribed to them
  - Solution: Added code to re-publish connection status events in ServiceController.ServiceLoop() method

## Configuration Requirements
The following configuration requirements are noted:

### Prosim Configuration
- Disable Auto-Door and Auto-Jetway Simulation in the EFB
