## Known Issues

### Integration Issues

1. **GSX Menu Interaction**
   - Occasional timing issues with GSX menu selection
   - Menu state detection can be unreliable
   - Operator selection sometimes requires manual intervention

2. **SimConnect Stability**
   - Connection can be lost during simulator updates
   - Some variables may not update reliably
   - Reconnection logic needs improvement

3. **ProSim Data Synchronization**
   - Occasional mismatches in passenger counts
   - Flight plan changes not always detected immediately
   - CG calculation can be inaccurate in certain scenarios

### Functional Issues

1. **Service Timing**
   - Boarding/deboarding sometimes completes before GSX animation finishes
   - Refueling rate may not match visual representation in GSX
   - Catering service sometimes requires manual intervention

2. **Audio Control**
   - Not all audio applications are detected reliably
   - Volume control can be inconsistent with some applications
   - Audio reset at session end doesn't always work with GSX

3. **State Management**
   - Rare cases where flight state transitions incorrectly
   - Equipment removal timing can be problematic in some scenarios
   - Turnaround detection occasionally fails

### User Interface Issues

1. **Configuration Clarity**
   - Some settings have unclear effects or interactions
   - Tooltips don't provide enough information for all options
   - Status indicators could be more informative

2. **Feedback**
   - Limited visual feedback for background operations
   - Log messages not always clear or actionable
   - Connection status could be more detailed

## Next Development Priorities

Based on the current state and known issues, the following priorities are recommended for future development:

1. **Stability Improvements**
   - Enhance error handling and recovery
   - Improve connection stability
   - Address known issues with service timing

2. **User Experience Enhancements**
   - Improve configuration clarity
   - Enhance status feedback
   - Provide more detailed logging

3. **Documentation Completion**
   - Finalize memory bank documentation
   - Create user documentation
   - Document troubleshooting procedures

4. **Testing and Validation**
   - Comprehensive testing across different scenarios
   - Validation with different versions of dependencies
   - Performance testing under various conditions
