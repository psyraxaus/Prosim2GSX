   - 🔄 Explicit dependencies through constructor injection
   - 🔜 Optional dependencies handled gracefully
   - 🔜 Lazy initialization for services not always needed
   - 🔜 Service locator for complex dependency scenarios

4. **Robust Error Handling**
   - 🔄 Service-specific exceptions
   - 🔜 Retry mechanisms for transient failures
   - 🔜 Circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
   - 🔜 Graceful degradation when dependencies fail

5. **Comprehensive Testing Strategy**
   - 🔄 Unit tests for new services
   - 🔜 Integration tests for service interactions
   - 🔜 Mock external dependencies
   - 🔜 Performance testing for critical paths

## Known Issues

### Door Management Issues

1. **Catering Door Opening Issue (Resolved)**
   - ✅ Fixed: Forward right passenger door no longer opens immediately after flight plan loading
   - ✅ Fixed: Door opening/closing loop issue has been resolved
   - ✅ Fixed root causes:
     - ✅ Modified GSXDoorCoordinator.ManageDoorsForStateAsync() to keep doors closed in DEPARTURE state
     - ✅ Added toggle state tracking in GSXServiceOrchestrator.CheckAllDoorToggles()
     - ✅ Added state verification in ProsimDoorService to prevent the infinite loop
     - ✅ Implemented dynamic toggle-to-door mapping in GSXDoorManager
     - ✅ Added circuit breaker to prevent rapid door state changes
     - ✅ Modified GSXDoorCoordinator to respect service toggles
   - 🔜 Remaining enhancements (Phase 3):
     - 🔜 Enhance logging for door operations
     - 🔜 Implement explicit door state initialization
   - Implementation plan available in to-do/catering-door-fix-implementation.md

### Integration Issues

1. **GSX Menu Interaction**
   - Occasional timing issues with GSX menu selection
   - Menu state detection can be unre
