# Progress Tracking: Prosim2GSX

## Project Status
The Prosim2GSX project is in a functional state with the core integration between Prosim A320 and GSX Pro working as expected. Recently, we've implemented a comprehensive Push-to-Talk (PTT) feature that allows users to configure keyboard shortcuts or joystick buttons for different ACP channels in ProSim. This feature includes a user-friendly configuration UI, real-time status display, and integration with the ACP channel system in Prosim.

Previous enhancements to service architecture with improved state management across multiple services have significantly improved the reliability and maintainability of the application. We've implemented a comprehensive state tracking pattern, added thread synchronization with dedicated lock objects, created service-specific log categories for better filtering, and improved error handling and recovery mechanisms.

Prior to these architectural improvements, we simplified the loadsheet generation process by removing redundant custom weight and balance calculations and fully relying on Prosim's native loadsheet functionality. This change removed unnecessary complexity and potential points of failure in the code. The redundant variables and methods related to custom weight and balance calculations were removed from GsxController.cs and ProsimController.cs, while keeping the enhanced error handling, server status checking, and retry logic in ProsimLoadsheetService.cs.

The code review confirms that the implementation follows the architecture and patterns described in the documentation. The event aggregator pattern is properly implemented with thread-safe operations and proper subscription management. The flight phase state machine is implemented with clear transitions and state-specific handlers. The loadsheet generation process includes proper error handling, server status checking, and retry logic. The audio integration supports both Windows Core Audio and VoiceMeeter with a flexible configuration system.

Prior to these simplifications, improvements to error handling for loadsheet generation and fixes for deboarding state handling have enhanced the reliability and robustness of the application. The implementation of server status checking, detailed HTTP status code interpretation, and better retry logic has significantly improved the diagnostics and recovery capabilities for loadsheet generation. The fixes to deboarding state handling have resolved an issue where deboarding was being called prematurely during departure.

The user interface has been updated to a new Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) look, providing a more modern and intuitive interface for users. This UI redesign improves the visual appearance and usability of the application while maintaining all the existing functionality. The new EFB-style interface follows design patterns common in modern aviation applications, making the tool more familiar to pilots who use similar interfaces in their flight operations.

Prior to this UI update, the implementation of an event aggregator system has significantly improved the UI responsiveness and decoupled components in the application. This implementation follows the publisher-subscriber pattern, allowing different parts of the application to communicate without direct dependencies. The event aggregator system enables real-time updates to the UI when monitored items change, such as service statuses, connection states, and flight phases.

The comprehensive Prosim dataref subscription system and cockpit door integration have further enhanced the application's capabilities and realism. The dataref subscription system provides a robust foundation for monitoring Prosim state changes, while the cockpit door integration allows for realistic sound muffling when the cockpit door is closed. Previous enhancements to the refueling process and improvements to the LVAR subscription system have also significantly improved the realism and reliability of the application. The application has been successfully migrated from .NET 7 to .NET 8, with all dependencies updated to their latest compatible versions.
