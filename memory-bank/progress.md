# Progress Tracking: Prosim2GSX

## Project Status
The Prosim2GSX project is in a functional state with the core integration between Prosim A320 and GSX Pro working as expected. The application has been successfully migrated from .NET 7 to .NET 8, with all dependencies updated to their latest compatible versions.

## Implemented Features

### Framework and Infrastructure
- ‚úÖ Migration from .NET 7 to .NET 8
- ‚úÖ Updated NuGet packages to latest versions
- ‚úÖ Version updated to 0.4.0

### Core Integration
- ‚úÖ Basic connectivity between Prosim A320 and GSX Pro
- ‚úÖ Event monitoring and synchronization
- ‚úÖ Configuration persistence

### Service Synchronization
- ‚úÖ Refueling synchronization between GSX and Prosim
- ‚úÖ Passenger and cargo boarding/deboarding synchronization
- ‚úÖ Ground equipment automation (GPU, Chocks, PCA)

### Automation
- ‚úÖ Automatic service calls (except Push-Back, De-Ice, Gate-Selection)
- ‚úÖ Automatic jetway/stair operation
- ‚úÖ Automatic ground equipment placement/removal

### Audio Control
- ‚úÖ GSX audio control via INT-Knob
- ‚úÖ ATC volume control via VHF1-Knob

### User Interface
- ‚úÖ System tray icon for configuration access
- ‚úÖ Configuration UI with tooltips
- ‚úÖ Persistent settings

## In Progress Features
- üîÑ Testing of the .NET 8 migration to ensure all functionality works as expected

## Planned Features
No specific planned features are documented at this time.

## Known Issues
Based on the README, there are some known considerations:

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential issues when used with FS2Crew (specifically "FS2Crew: Prosim A320 Edition")
- ‚ö†Ô∏è GSX audio may stay muted when switching to another plane if it was muted during the session
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Extreme passenger density setting in GSX breaks boarding functionality

## Configuration Requirements
The following configuration requirements are noted:

### Prosim Configuration
- Disable Auto-Door and Auto-Jetway Simulation in the EFB

### GSX Pro Configuration
- No customized Aircraft Config should be used
- "Assistance services Auto Mode" should be disabled
- "Always refuel progressively" and "Detect custom aircraft system refueling" may need to be disabled if refueling issues occur
- Passenger Density setting should not be set to "Extreme"

## Testing Status
Initial build testing of the .NET 8 migration has been completed successfully. Comprehensive functional testing is still needed to ensure all features work correctly with the new framework.

## Documentation Status
- ‚úÖ README with installation and usage instructions
- ‚úÖ Configuration requirements documented
- ‚úÖ Service flow documented
- ‚úÖ Memory bank initialized and updated for .NET 8 migration
- ‚úÖ Technical documentation updated to reflect .NET 8 requirements

## Next Development Priorities
Current development priorities include:

1. Thorough testing of the .NET 8 migration
2. Creating release notes for the .NET 8 update
3. Addressing known issues with FS2Crew compatibility
4. Improving audio control persistence between sessions
5. Adding support for the "Extreme" passenger density setting
6. Expanding automation capabilities to include Push-Back, De-Ice, and Gate-Selection
7. Enhancing error handling and recovery mechanisms
8. Adding more configuration options for advanced users
9. Exploring new features available in .NET 8

## Deployment Status
The project is in a deployable state following the .NET 8 migration. The README will need to be updated to reflect the new .NET 8 runtime requirement before the next release.

## User Adoption
No specific information on user adoption is available at this time.

## Performance Metrics
No performance metrics are documented. Future updates could include:

- Service call response times
- Synchronization accuracy
- Resource usage statistics
- Error rates during operation
