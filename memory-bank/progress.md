# Progress Tracking: Prosim2GSX

## Project Status
The Prosim2GSX project appears to be in a functional state based on the README documentation. The core integration between Prosim A320 and GSX Pro is working, with various automated features implemented.

## Implemented Features

### Core Integration
- ✅ Basic connectivity between Prosim A320 and GSX Pro
- ✅ Event monitoring and synchronization
- ✅ Configuration persistence

### Service Synchronization
- ✅ Refueling synchronization between GSX and Prosim
- ✅ Passenger and cargo boarding/deboarding synchronization
- ✅ Ground equipment automation (GPU, Chocks, PCA)

### Automation
- ✅ Automatic service calls (except Push-Back, De-Ice, Gate-Selection)
- ✅ Automatic jetway/stair operation
- ✅ Automatic ground equipment placement/removal

### Audio Control
- ✅ GSX audio control via INT-Knob
- ✅ ATC volume control via VHF1-Knob

### User Interface
- ✅ System tray icon for configuration access
- ✅ Configuration UI with tooltips
- ✅ Persistent settings

## In Progress Features
No features are currently marked as in-progress based on available documentation.

## Planned Features
No specific planned features are documented at this time.

## Known Issues
Based on the README, there are some known considerations:

- ⚠️ Potential issues when used with FS2Crew (specifically "FS2Crew: Prosim A320 Edition")
- ⚠️ GSX audio may stay muted when switching to another plane if it was muted during the session
- ⚠️ Extreme passenger density setting in GSX breaks boarding functionality

## Configuration Requirements
The following configuration requirements are noted:

### Prosim Configuration
- Disable Auto-Door and Auto-Jetway Simulation in the EFB

### GSX Pro Configuration
- No customized Aircraft Config should be used
- "Assistance services Auto Mode" should be disabled
- "Always refuel progressively" and "Detect custom aircraft system refueling" may need to be disabled if refueling issues occur
- Passenger Density setting should not be set to "Extreme"

## Testing Status
No formal testing status is documented. The project appears to be functionally tested through real-world usage.

## Documentation Status
- ✅ README with installation and usage instructions
- ✅ Configuration requirements documented
- ✅ Service flow documented
- ✅ Memory bank initialized

## Next Development Priorities
Without specific information on planned features or current issues, potential development priorities might include:

1. Addressing known issues with FS2Crew compatibility
2. Improving audio control persistence between sessions
3. Adding support for the "Extreme" passenger density setting
4. Expanding automation capabilities to include Push-Back, De-Ice, and Gate-Selection
5. Enhancing error handling and recovery mechanisms
6. Adding more configuration options for advanced users

## Deployment Status
The project appears to be in a deployable state, with clear installation instructions provided in the README.

## User Adoption
No specific information on user adoption is available at this time.

## Performance Metrics
No performance metrics are documented. Future updates could include:

- Service call response times
- Synchronization accuracy
- Resource usage statistics
- Error rates during operation
