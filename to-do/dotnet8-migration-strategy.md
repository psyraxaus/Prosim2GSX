| Newtonsoft.Json | 13.0.3 | 13.0.3 (no change) | No action required |
| Serilog | 2.12.0 | 3.1.1 or later | Update to latest version |
| Serilog.Sinks.File | 5.0.0 | 5.0.0 (no change) | No action required |
| Microsoft.Windows.Compatibility | 8.0.8 | 8.0.8 (no change) | No action required |

#### External References

| Reference | Action Required |
|-----------|----------------|
| Microsoft.FlightSimulator.SimConnect.dll | Test compatibility with .NET 8.0 |
| ProSimSDK.dll | Test compatibility with .NET 8.0 |

### 3. Potential Breaking Changes

#### .NET 7.0 to .NET 8.0 Breaking Changes

1. **WPF Changes**:
   - Some WPF controls may have behavior changes
   - Focus and keyboard navigation improvements may affect UI behavior

2. **Runtime Changes**:
   - JIT compiler optimizations may affect application behavior
   - Changes to garbage collection may affect performance

3. **API Changes**:
   - Some APIs may be deprecated or have changed behavior
   - New APIs may be available that could improve application performance

4. **Dependency Injection Changes**:
   - If using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection, there may be changes to service registration and resolution

5. **Threading Changes**:
   - Changes to thread pool behavior may affect application performance
   - Task scheduling improvements may affect asynchronous operations

### 4. Code Modifications

#### Required Changes

1. **Update NuGet Packages**:
   ```powershell
   Update-Package CefSharp.OffScreen.NETCore
   Update-Package CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
   Update-Package CoreAudio
   Update-Package H.NotifyIcon.Wpf
   Update-Package Serilog
   ```

2. **Review and Update Deprecated API Usage**:
   - Scan codebase for deprecated API usage
   - Replace deprecated APIs with recommended alternatives

3. **Update SDK References**:
   - Ensure SDK references are compatible with .NET 8.0
   - Update SDK references if necessary

#### Optional Improvements

1. **Leverage .NET 8.0 Features**:
   - Native AOT compilation for improved startup time
   - Improved memory management
   - Enhanced performance with new APIs

2. **Update Build Pipeline**:
   - Update CI/CD pipeline to use .NET 8.0 SDK
   - Update build scripts to target .NET 8.0

### 5. Testing Strategy

#### Unit Testing

1. **Update Test Framework**:
   - Update test projects to target .NET 8.0
   - Update test dependencies to compatible versions

2. **Run Existing Tests**:
   - Run all existing unit tests to verify functionality
   - Address any test failures related to .NET 8.0 migration

#### Integration Testing

1. **Test External Dependencies**:
   - Test integration with SimConnect
   - Test integration with ProSimSDK
   - Test integration with GSX

2. **Test Application Workflows**:
   - Test all major application workflows
   - Verify that all features work as expected

#### Performance Testing

1. **Benchmark Application Performance**:
   - Compare application startup time
   - Compare memory usage
   - Compare CPU usage during typical operations

2. **Stress Testing**:
   - Test application under heavy load
   - Verify stability during extended operation

### 6. Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues that cannot be resolved in a timely manner, follow these steps to rollback to .NET 7.0:

1. **Revert Framework Change**:
   - Revert the target framework in the Prosim2GSX.csproj file to net7.0-windows10.0.17763.0
   - Revert any package updates that are not compatible with .NET 7.0

2. **Revert Code Changes**:
   - Revert any code changes made specifically for .NET 8.0 compatibility
   - Restore any code that was removed or modified during the migration

3. **Rebuild and Test**:
   - Rebuild the application with .NET 7.0
   - Run tests to verify functionality

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Description | Estimated Duration |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| Preparation | Update project file and dependencies | 1 day |
| Code Modifications | Address breaking changes and update code | 2-3 days |
| Testing | Run tests and verify functionality | 2-3 days |
| Deployment | Deploy the updated application | 1 day |
| Monitoring | Monitor for issues and address as needed | Ongoing |

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Incompatible dependencies | High | Medium | Test dependencies thoroughly before full migration |
| Breaking changes in .NET 8.0 | High | Low | Review breaking changes documentation and test thoroughly |
| Performance regression | Medium | Low | Benchmark performance before and after migration |
| Integration issues with external systems | High | Medium | Test integration points thoroughly |

## Conclusion

Migrating Prosim2GSX from .NET 7.0 to .NET 8.0 will ensure the application remains up-to-date with the latest .NET framework. The migration will require careful planning, testing, and monitoring to ensure a smooth transition. By following the steps outlined in this document, the migration can be completed with minimal disruption to users.
