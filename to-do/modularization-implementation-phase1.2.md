# Prosim2GSX Modularization Implementation - Phase 1.2

## Phase 1.2: ProsimService Implementation

### Changes Made

1. **Service Interface Creation**
   - Created `IProsimService.cs` interface in the Services folder:
     ```csharp
     public interface IProsimService
     {
         bool IsConnected { get; }
         void Connect(string hostname);
         dynamic ReadDataRef(string dataRef);
         void SetVariable(string dataRef, object value);
         event EventHandler<ProsimConnectionEventArgs> ConnectionChanged;
     }
     ```
   - Defined event argument classes for connection state changes and data changes

2. **Service Implementation**
   - Created `ProsimService.cs` implementation file in the Services folder
   - Implemented the ProSim connection logic
   - Added event handling for connection state changes
   - Implemented data reading and writing methods
   - Added error handling and logging

3. **ProsimInterface Updates**
   - Refactored `ProsimInterface.cs` to use ProsimService:
     - Added dependency on IProsimService
     - Delegated ProSim operations to the service
     - Maintained backward compatibility for existing code
     - Improved error handling with service-provided events

4. **Unit Tests**
   - Created basic unit tests for ProsimService
   - Tested constructor validation
   - Tested event handling for connection changes

### Code Improvements

1. **Error Handling Enhancements**
   - Added comprehensive exception handling in ProsimService
   - Implemented event-based notification for connection state changes
   - Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

2. **Code Organization**
   - Separated ProSim SDK interaction into a dedicated service
   - Defined clear interface for ProSim operations
   - Improved separation of concerns

3. **Maintainability Improvements**
   - Reduced code duplication
   - Centralized ProSim SDK interaction
   - Made dependencies explicit through interfaces

### Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Separation of Concerns**
   - ProsimService now handles all direct ProSim SDK interactions
   - ProsimInterface acts as an adapter for backward compatibility
   - ProsimController can focus on business logic

2. **Enhanced Testability**
   - Service can be mocked for testing
   - Clear interface makes unit testing easier
   - Event-based architecture improves testability

3. **Better Error Handling**
   - Centralized error management
   - Consistent logging and reporting
   - Event-based notification of connection state changes

4. **Future Extensibility**
   - New ProSim features can be added to the service
   - Multiple implementations possible (for testing, etc.)
   - Easier to adapt to ProSim SDK changes

### Next Steps

1. **Complete Unit Testing**
   - Add more comprehensive tests for ProsimService
   - Test with mock ProSim SDK
   - Verify error handling and recovery

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test the complete system
   - Verify all ProSim interactions work correctly
   - Ensure no regression in functionality

3. **Move to Phase 2**
   - Extract shared and ProSim-specific services
   - Implement AcarsService
   - Implement FlightPlanService
   - Implement domain-specific ProSim services

## Conclusion

The implementation of Phase 1.2 (ProsimService) has been successfully completed. The service provides a clean, well-defined interface for ProSim operations, improving code organization, testability, and maintainability. The changes have been integrated with the existing codebase while maintaining backward compatibility.

This phase completes the extraction of core services (SimConnectService and ProsimService), setting the foundation for further modularization in Phase 2.
