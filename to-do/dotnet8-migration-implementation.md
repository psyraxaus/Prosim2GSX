# .NET 8.0 Migration Implementation

## Changes Made

1. **Framework Update**
   - Updated target framework in Prosim2GSX.csproj:
     ```xml
     <TargetFramework>net8.0-windows10.0.17763.0</TargetFramework>
     ```

2. **NuGet Package Updates**
   - Updated NuGet packages to .NET 8.0 compatible versions:
     - CefSharp.OffScreen.NETCore: 112.3.0 -> 120.1.110
     - CommunityToolkit.Mvvm: 8.2.0 -> 8.2.2
     - CoreAudio: 1.27.0 -> 1.37.0
     - H.NotifyIcon.Wpf: 2.0.108 -> 2.0.124
     - Serilog: 2.12.0 -> 3.1.1
     - chromiumembeddedframework.runtime packages: 112.3.0 -> 120.1.110

3. **Code Updates for .NET 8.0 Compatibility**

   ### XML Handling Improvements
   - Updated ConfigurationFile.cs to use XmlReader and XmlWriter with explicit settings
   - Added security enhancements for XML processing (DtdProcessing.Prohibit, null XmlResolver)
   - Improved XML formatting with explicit settings

   ### Culture and Formatting Enhancements
   - Updated RealInvariantFormat.cs to use CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo for better performance
   - Added comments to explain the changes

   ### CefSharp Initialization Updates
   - Enhanced CefSharp initialization in App.xaml.cs with additional settings
   - Added GPU-related command line arguments for better compatibility
   - Improved error handling and logging

   ### System.Drawing Compatibility
   - Added null checking and exception handling for icon loading
   - Improved error reporting for System.Drawing operations

   ### Application Startup Improvements
   - Enhanced error handling during application startup
   - Added directory existence checks and creation
   - Improved configuration file handling
   - Added comprehensive exception handling

   ### Logging Enhancements
   - Updated Serilog configuration for better performance in .NET 8.0
   - Added log directory existence check and creation
   - Improved log level handling
   - Implemented memory-only fallback logger if file logging fails
   - Enhanced log flushing behavior
   - Improved error messaging for logging failures

## Testing Performed

1. **Build Verification**
   - Verified that the application builds successfully with .NET 8.0
   - Addressed compilation warnings related to nullable reference types
   - Fixed build error related to missing Serilog.Sinks.Console package by implementing a memory-only fallback logger

2. **Code Review**
   - Performed detailed review of all modified files
   - Ensured that changes maintain backward compatibility
   - Verified that error handling is comprehensive

## Remaining Tasks

1. **Thorough Testing**
   - Test the application with the new framework and packages
   - Verify that all features work as expected
   - Pay special attention to areas that were modified:
     - XML configuration handling
     - CefSharp browser functionality
     - System tray icon display
     - Logging behavior

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test integration with external systems:
     - SimConnect connectivity
     - ProSim SDK functionality
     - GSX service automation
     - Audio control features

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark key operations:
     - Application startup time
     - Memory usage during operation
     - CPU utilization during service calls
   - Compare with .NET 7 baseline

4. **Documentation Update**
   - Update user documentation to reflect the migration to .NET 8.0
   - Document any changes in behavior or new features
   - Update version information in the application

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **External DLL Compatibility**
   - Monitor for any issues with SimConnect.dll and ProSimSDK.dll
   - These external dependencies might need additional compatibility work

2. **WPF UI Behavior**
   - Watch for any changes in UI behavior, particularly around focus and keyboard navigation
   - Test all UI interactions thoroughly

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - Monitor for any performance regressions
   - Implement additional .NET 8.0 performance improvements if needed

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are encountered that cannot be resolved in a timely manner:

1. Revert the target framework in Prosim2GSX.csproj to net7.0-windows10.0.17763.0
2. Revert NuGet package versions to their original values
3. Revert code changes made specifically for .NET 8.0 compatibility
4. Rebuild and test with .NET 7.0

## Conclusion

The migration to .NET 8.0 has been implemented with a focus on maintaining compatibility while taking advantage of new features and improvements. The changes made should provide better performance, security, and reliability while maintaining the existing functionality of the application.
