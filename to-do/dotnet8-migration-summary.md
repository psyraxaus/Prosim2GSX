## Next Steps

### Testing

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Test all major application workflows
   - Verify that all features work as expected
   - Pay special attention to areas that were modified

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test integration with SimConnect
   - Test integration with ProSim SDK
   - Test GSX service automation
   - Test audio control features

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Compare application startup time with .NET 7.0 version
   - Monitor memory usage during operation
   - Measure CPU utilization during service calls

### Deployment

1. **Release Preparation**
   - Create release notes documenting the migration to .NET 8.0
   - Highlight any changes in behavior or new features
   - Document any known issues or limitations

2. **Distribution**
   - Package the application for distribution
   - Consider creating an installer for easier deployment
   - Provide clear upgrade instructions for existing users

3. **Post-Release Monitoring**
   - Monitor for any issues reported by users
   - Prepare for quick fixes if necessary
   - Collect feedback for future improvements

## Potential Issues to Watch For

1. **External DLL Compatibility**
   - SimConnect.dll and ProSimSDK.dll might have compatibility issues with .NET 8.0
   - Monitor for any unexpected behavior when interacting with these libraries

2. **WPF UI Behavior**
   - Some WPF controls might behave differently in .NET 8.0
   - Pay attention to focus and keyboard navigation

3. **Performance Considerations**
   - .NET 8.0 might have different performance characteristics
   - Monitor for any performance regressions

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are encountered that cannot be resolved in a timely manner:

1. Revert the target framework in Prosim2GSX.csproj to net7.0-windows10.0.17763.0
2. Revert NuGet package versions to their original values
3. Revert code changes made specifically for .NET 8.0 compatibility
4. Rebuild and test with .NET 7.0

## Conclusion

The migration to .NET 8.0 has been successfully implemented, with all necessary code changes and dependency updates. The application builds successfully with the new framework, and the next steps are to thoroughly test the application and prepare for deployment.

The migration should provide several benefits:
- Improved performance and security
- Access to new .NET 8.0 features and APIs
- Extended support lifecycle
- Better compatibility with modern development tools and practices

These improvements will help ensure that Prosim2GSX remains a reliable and efficient tool for integrating ProsimA320 with GSX in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2020.
