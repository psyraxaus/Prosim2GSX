- Created `IProsimCargoService` interface and `ProsimCargoService` implementation
- Extracted cargo management logic
- Added methods for retrieving and setting cargo data

#### Phase 2.10: ProsimFluidService
- Created `IProsimFluidService` interface and `ProsimFluidService` implementation
- Extracted fluid management logic
- Added methods for retrieving and setting fluid data

### Phase 3: GSX Service Extraction

#### Phase 3.1: GSX Menu Service
- Enhanced `IGSXMenuService` interface and `GSXMenuService` implementation
- Added methods for interacting with GSX menu
- Improved error handling and logging

#### Phase 3.2: GSX Audio Service

#### Phase 3.4: GSX Door Manager
- Created `IGSXDoorManager` interface and `GSXDoorManager` implementation
- Extracted door management logic from GsxController
- Added methods for controlling aircraft doors
- Added event-based communication for door state changes

#### Phase 3.5: GSX Loadsheet Manager
- Created `IGSXLoadsheetManager` interface and `GSXLoadsheetManager` implementation
- Extracted loadsheet management logic from GsxController
- Added methods for generating and sending loadsheets
- Added event-based communication for loadsheet generation

#### Phase 3.6: Refine GsxController
- Refactored GsxController to be a thin facade
- Delegated responsibilities to specialized services
- Improved event handling and state management
- Enhanced error handling and logging

## Benefits

### Improved Separation of Concerns
- Each service has a single responsibility
- Services are focused on specific aspects of the system
- GsxController is simplified and more focused

### Enhanced Testability
- Services can be tested in isolation
- Dependencies are explicit and can be mocked
- Unit tests can be written for each component

### Better Maintainability
- Changes to one service don't affect other services
- New features can be added without modifying existing code
- Code is more modular and easier to maintain

### Event-Based Communication
- Components communicate through events
- Reduces tight coupling between components
- Makes the system more extensible

### Clearer Responsibility Boundaries
- Each service has a clear responsibility
- GsxController orchestrates the services
- Services don't need to know about each other

## Next Steps

### Phase 4: Comprehensive Unit Testing
- Implement unit tests for all components
- Ensure high test coverage
- Verify correct behavior of all services

### Phase 5: Documentation
- Update code documentation
- Create architecture documentation
- Document design decisions and patterns

### Phase 6: Performance Optimization
- Identify performance bottlenecks
- Optimize critical paths
- Improve resource usage

## Conclusion

The modularization of Prosim2GSX has significantly improved the codebase's maintainability, testability, and extensibility. By applying SOLID principles and modern software design patterns, we've created a more robust and flexible system that can be easily extended and maintained in the future.

The new architecture allows for:
- Independent development and testing of components
- Easier addition of new features
- Better error handling and recovery
- Clearer understanding of the system's behavior

These improvements will make it easier to add new features, fix bugs, and maintain the codebase over time.
