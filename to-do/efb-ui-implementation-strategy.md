# EFB-Style UI Implementation Strategy for Prosim2GSX

## Overview

This document outlines a phased implementation strategy for creating a new Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) style user interface for Prosim2GSX. The new UI will provide a more realistic and intuitive experience that resembles actual EFBs used by A320 pilots, with customization options for different airlines and optimizations for secondary monitor use.

## Implementation Dependencies

This implementation should be scheduled after:
1. The .NET 8.0 migration (outlined in `dotnet8-migration-strategy.md`)
2. The modularisation of GSXController and ProsimController classes

## Phased Implementation Approach

The implementation is divided into six phases, each with clear deliverables and milestones. This approach allows for incremental development based on available time, with each phase building upon the previous one.

## Minimal Viable Product (MVP) Approach

If time constraints are significant, the following represents a minimal viable product approach that delivers core functionality:

1. **MVP Phase 1: Core Framework** (2 weeks)
   - Basic window management
   - Simple navigation system
   - Data binding to existing ServiceModel

2. **MVP Phase 2: Essential UI** (3 weeks)
   - Home dashboard with basic status indicators
   - Services page with core functionality
   - Simple aircraft status visualization

This MVP approach would require approximately 5 weeks of development time and would deliver a functional, if simplified, EFB-style interface.

## Incremental Feature Implementation

The following features can be implemented incrementally as time allows:

1. **Aircraft Visualization** - Can be added after the basic UI is functional
2. **Airline Theming** - Can be implemented with a basic theme first, then expanded
3. **Voice Feedback** - Optional feature that can be added at any time
4. **Advanced Logging** - Can be enhanced gradually after basic logging is in place
5. **Theme Editor** - Optional tool that can be developed separately

## Resource Requirements

### Development Tools
- Visual Studio 2022
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- WPF design tools
- JSON schema validation tools

### Assets
- Aircraft diagram SVG/XAML
- Airline logos and branding assets
- EFB control images and icons
- Font resources for airline-specific typography

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Test theme engine components
   - Validate data binding mechanisms
   - Verify navigation and state preservation

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test integration with existing ServiceModel
   - Verify interaction with GSXController and ProsimController
   - Validate multi-window functionality

3. **User Testing**
   - Conduct usability testing with virtual pilots
   - Gather feedback on layout and workflow
   - Validate readability on secondary monitors

## Conclusion

This phased implementation strategy allows for the development of a realistic EFB-style UI for Prosim2GSX that can be built incrementally based on available time. Each phase delivers tangible improvements to the user experience, with the complete implementation providing a highly realistic and intuitive interface optimized for use on secondary monitors.

The strategy prioritizes core functionality first, with more advanced features implemented in later phases. This approach ensures that even with limited development time, users can benefit from meaningful improvements to the interface.
