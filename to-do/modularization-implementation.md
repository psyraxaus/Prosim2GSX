# Prosim2GSX Modularization Implementation

## Phase 1.1: SimConnectService Implementation

### Changes Made

1. **Service Interface Creation**
   - Created `ISimConnectService.cs` interface in the Services folder:
     ```csharp
     public interface ISimConnectService
     {
         event EventHandler<SimConnectEventArgs> SimConnectEvent;
         event EventHandler<SimConnectDataReceivedEventArgs> DataReceived;
         
         bool IsConnected { get; }
         
         void Connect();
         void Disconnect();
         void SendEvent(SimConnectEvents eventId, uint data = 0);
         void RequestData(SimConnectDataDefinitions definition);
         void SetData(SimConnectDataDefinitions definition, object data);
         void ProcessSimConnectMessage();
     }
     ```

2. **Service Implementation**
   - Created `SimConnectService.cs` implementation file in the Services folder
   - Implemented the SimConnect connection logic
   - Added event handling for SimConnect events
   - Implemented data request and transmission methods
   - Added error handling and logging

3. **MobiDefinitions Updates**
   - Updated `MobiDefinitions.cs` to include all required enums and structs:
     - Added `SimConnectEvents` enum
     - Added `SimConnectDataDefinitions` enum
     - Added data structures for SimConnect communication
     - Ensured compatibility with SimConnectService

4. **MobiSimConnect Updates**
   - Refactored `MobiSimConnect.cs` to use SimConnectService:
     - Removed direct SimConnect handling
     - Added dependency on ISimConnectService
     - Updated event handling to use service events
     - Simplified code by delegating to the service

5. **IPCManager Updates**
   - Updated `IPCManager.cs` to work with SimConnectService:
     - Added dependency on ISimConnectService
     - Updated IPC message handling to use service methods
     - Improved error handling with service-provided information

6. **Dependency Injection Setup**
   - Added service registration in the application startup
   - Implemented constructor injection for dependent classes
   - Ensured proper service lifecycle management

### Code Improvements

1. **Error Handling Enhancements**
   - Added comprehensive exception handling in SimConnectService
   - Implemented retry logic for connection failures
   - Added detailed logging for troubleshooting

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Optimized data request frequency
   - Implemented caching for frequently accessed data
   - Reduced unnecessary SimConnect calls

3. **Thread Safety Improvements**
   - Added thread synchronization for SimConnect operations
   - Implemented thread-safe event raising
   - Ensured proper thread context for UI updates

4. **Memory Management**
   - Implemented proper disposal of SimConnect resources
   - Added cleanup of event handlers to prevent memory leaks
   - Optimized data structure usage to reduce memory footprint

### Unit Tests

1. **Service Tests**
   - Created unit tests for SimConnectService
   - Implemented mock SimConnect for testing
   - Added tests for all public methods and events
   - Verified error handling and edge cases

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Added tests for integration with MobiSimConnect
   - Tested interaction with IPCManager
   - Verified event propagation through the system

### Testing Performed

1. **Functional Testing**
   - Verified SimConnect connection and disconnection
   - Tested data request and transmission
   - Confirmed event handling functionality
   - Validated error handling and recovery

2. **Performance Testing**
   - Measured connection time
   - Evaluated data request latency
   - Assessed memory usage during operation
   - Compared performance with previous implementation

3. **Regression Testing**
   - Ensured existing functionality continues to work
   - Verified compatibility with other components
   - Confirmed no unexpected side effects

## Conclusion

The implementation of Phase 1.1 (SimConnectService) has been successfully completed. The service provides a clean, well-defined interface for SimConnect operations, improving code organization, testability, and maintainability. The changes have been thoroughly tested and integrated with the existing codebase.

The next phase (1.2 ProsimService) will build on this foundation to further improve the modularization of the application.
