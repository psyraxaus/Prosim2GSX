# Prosim2GSX Modularization Implementation - Phase 2.2 FlightPlanService

## Overview

This document details the implementation of Phase 2.2 of the Prosim2GSX modularization strategy, which focused on extracting flight plan loading and parsing functionality into a dedicated service.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Created Service Interface

Created `IFlightPlanService.cs` in the Services folder with the following interface:

```csharp
public interface IFlightPlanService
{
    Task<bool> LoadFlightPlanAsync();
    Task<XmlNode> GetFlightPlanDataAsync();
    Task<XmlNode> FetchOnlineFlightPlanAsync();
    event EventHandler<FlightPlanEventArgs> FlightPlanLoaded;
}
```

The interface defines methods for loading flight plans, retrieving flight plan data, and an event for notifying when a new flight plan is loaded.

### 2. Implemented Service Class

Created `FlightPlanService.cs` in the Services folder that:

- Implements the `IFlightPlanService` interface
- Encapsulates all flight plan loading and parsing logic
- Handles HTTP requests to fetch flight plans from online sources
- Implements secure XML processing with proper settings
- Provides comprehensive error handling and logging
- Raises events when new flight plans are loaded

Key methods implemented:

- `LoadFlightPlanAsync`: Loads a flight plan and determines if it's new
- `GetFlightPlanDataAsync`: Retrieves flight plan data
- `FetchOnlineFlightPlanAsync`: Fetches flight plan data from online sources

### 3. Refactored FlightPlan Class

Modified `FlightPlan.cs` to:

- Accept an `IFlightPlanService` through dependency injection in the constructor
- Delegate flight plan loading to the service
- Extract parsing logic into a separate method
- Remove methods that were moved to the service
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing code

Key changes:

- Updated constructor to accept and store the service
- Modified `Load()` method to use the service
- Extracted parsing logic to a separate `ParseFlightPlanData()` method
- Improved error handling

### 4. Updated ServiceController

Modified `ServiceController.cs` to:

- Create an instance of `FlightPlanService`
- Pass it to the `FlightPlan` constructor
- Ensure proper initialization order

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Improved Separation of Concerns**
   - Flight plan loading and parsing logic is now isolated in a dedicated service
   - FlightPlan class focuses on being a data model rather than handling loading logic
   - ServiceController manages the lifecycle of services

2. **Enhanced Testability**
   - The service can be mocked for testing FlightPlan
   - Flight plan loading can be tested independently
   - Clear interfaces make unit testing easier

3. **Better Error Handling**
   - Centralized error management in the service
   - Consistent logging and reporting
   - Proper exception handling for asynchronous operations

4. **Future Extensibility**
   - Support for different flight plan sources can be added to the service
   - Multiple implementations possible (for testing, etc.)
   - Event-based architecture allows for reactive programming

5. **Improved Security**
   - Secure XML processing with proper settings
   - DtdProcessing.Prohibit for security
   - XmlResolver set to null to prevent external entity resolution

## Next Steps

The successful implementation of Phase 2.2 continues the modularization process. The next phases should follow a similar pattern of:

1. Defining clear interfaces
2. Implementing services with focused responsibilities
3. Updating existing code to use the new services
4. Testing to ensure functionality is maintained

The next phase to implement is Phase 2.3 ProsimDoorService, which will extract door-related methods from ProsimController.
